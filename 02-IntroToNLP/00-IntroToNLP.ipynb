    "## Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python's NLTK\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most frequent tasks in computational text analysis is quickly summarizing the content of text. In this lesson we will learn how to summarze text by counting frequent words using Python's nltk. In the process we'll learn a different way to count the words in a text, and we'll cover some common pre-processing steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing is an umbrella term that incorporates many techiques and methods to process, analyze, and understand natural languages (as opposed to artificial languages like logics, or Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals:\n",
    "The goal of this lesson is to jump right in to text analysis and natural language processing. This lesson will demonstrate some neat things you can do with a minimal amount of coding.  <br /> <br />  In this tutorial you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get an introduction to the Python package NLTK, what functionality it offers, and learn some important NLP terms\n",
    "* Learn how to do a variety of forms of counting using NLTK, and think about why these might help researchers analyze text\n",
    "* Learn about pre-processing steps and why you might or might not do them\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson Outline:\n",
    "* [Tokenizing Text and Type-Token Ratio](#ttr)\n",
    "    * Number of words\n",
    "    * Type-Token Ratio\n",
    "* [Most frequent words](#frequent_words)\n",

    "\n",
    "* *stop words*: \n",
    "    * The most common words in a language.\n",
    "* *tokenization*:\n",
    "    * Given a character sequence and a defined document unit, tokenization is the task of chopping it up into pieces, called tokens , perhaps at the same time throwing away certain characters, such as punctuation. \n",
    "* *token*:\n",
    "    *  A token is an instance of a sequence of characters in some particular document that are grouped together as a useful semantic unit for processing.\n",
    "* *type*:\n",
    "    * A type is the class of all tokens containing the same character sequence.\n",
